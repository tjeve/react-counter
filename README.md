A simple React Counter

Future updates:
* Adding a button that creates other counters - DONE
* Fixing the formatting of the buttons
* Put components into modules - DONE
* Store the state in the local storage so that when refreshed counters hold value
* Raise the state of "num" and use props to communicate with other componenets so that "num" syncs across counters
* Reverse the order of the counters so that new counters appear on the bottom.
* Add a name to the Counters to keep score.
* Add a form or menu to choose the number of starting counters.

Bugs:
* When the top counter is incremented and a new counter is added, the top counter resets.
